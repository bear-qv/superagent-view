          <p>
            Each menu item is limited to a single line of text that describes the
            action it will perform when selected.
          </p>

          <p>
            The text is generally a single word or short phrase, but it can include
            icons and helper text, like keyboard shortcuts, as well as controls like
          </p>
          checkmarks to indicate multiple selected items or states. See also
          List controls.

          <p>
            Menus with static content should have the most frequently used
            menu items placed at the top of the menu.
          </p>

          <p>
            Menus with dynamic content may have other behavior, such as
            placing previously used fonts at the top of the menu. The order
          </p>
          can change based on user actions.

          <p>
            Menu items can reveal nested submenus. Try to limit nesting to one
            level deep, as it can be difficult to navigate multiple nested submenus.
